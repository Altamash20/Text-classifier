# BERT based Text-classifier model 
<b>Problem Statement:</b>
<br>
There are scenarios when it is required to categorize a piece of text. Consider case 
of a large dataset of news headlines where it needs to be determined as a 
sarcastic one or not. Keeping it in mind develop a model using a real time dataset 
for training. Fine tune the hyper-parameters of model as per requirement.
<br>
<b>Proposed solution:</b>
<br>
The proposed system aims to predict the presence of sarcasm in a given news headline. This involves training over a large dataset of news headlines and BERT based algorithm to develop the model. The solution will consist of the following:
<br>
1. <b>Data Collection</b>: Gather news headlines from various journals, articles and newspapers.<br>
2. <b>Data Preprocessing</b>: Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.<br>
3. <b>Machine Learning Algorithm</b>: BERT based algorithm is used to develop the model.<br>
4. <b>Deployment</b>:
<br>a) Develop a user-friendly interface or application that provides real-time sarcasm detection in a given news headline.
<br>b) Deploy the solution on a scalable and reliable platform, considering factors like server infrastructure, response time, and user accessibility.<br>
5. <b>Evaluation</b>:
<br>a) Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or other relevant metrics.
<br>b) Fine-tune the model based on feedback and continuous monitoring of prediction accuracy.
<br>
<b>System requirements</b>: Compute Engine, Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)
<br>
<br>
<b>Library required to build the model</b>:
<br>
<br>1. torch<br> 
2. transformers<br> 
3. sklearn<br> 
4. matplotlib<br> 
5. numpy<br>
6. pandas

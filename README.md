# BERT based Text-classifier model 
<b>Problem Statement:</b>
<br>
There are scenarios when it is required to categorize a piece of text. Consider case 
of a large dataset of news headlines where it needs to be determined as a 
sarcastic one or not. Keeping it in mind develop a model using a real time dataset 
for training. Fine tune the hyper-parameters of model as per requirement.
<br>
<b>Proposed solution:</b>
<br>
The proposed system aims to predict the presence of sarcasm in a given news headline. This involves training over a large dataset of news headlines and BERT based algorithm to develop the model. The solution will consist of the following:
<br>
1. Data Collection: Gather news headlines from various journals, articles and newspapers.<br>
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.<br>
3. Machine Learning Algorithm: BERT based algorithm is used to develop the model.<br>
4. Deployment:<br><br>
1. Develop a user-friendly interface or application that provides real-time sarcasm detection in a given news headline.<br>
2. Deploy the solution on a scalable and reliable platform, considering factors like server infrastructure, response time, and user accessibility.<br>
    

6) Evaluation:
<br>
• Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or other relevant metrics.
<br> 
• Fine-tune the model based on feedback and continuous monitoring of prediction accuracy.
